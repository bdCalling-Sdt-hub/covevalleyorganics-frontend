          Sustainability at Cove Valley
        </h2>
        <p className="">
          At Cove Valley, we believe in making choices that are not only good
          for babies but also good for the planet. Currently, our focus is on
          sourcing organic ingredients from trusted farms that prioritize
          natural, eco-friendly farming methods. We are committed to evolving
          our approach and making sustainability an integral part of Cove
          Valley’s growth. We believe that small steps lead to big changes!
        </p>
        <p className="">
          We’re mindful of the materials we use to store and package our
          products. Our ice trays are made from polypropylene (PP), which is a
          durable, recyclable, and eco-friendly plastic.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          Our freezer bags are made from PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate), PE
          (Polyethylene), and MOPP (Metallized Oriented Polypropylene)—three
          materials that offer significant benefits: Superior durability,
          excellent moisture barrier protection, and enhanced freshness
          retention, ensuring your baby’s food stays safe and delicious.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          We believe in nourishing not just our little ones but also our planet.
          While we recognize that achieving full sustainability is a journey, we
          are committed to using recyclable materials and promoting eco-friendly
          practices. Our goal is to minimize waste and ensure transparency in
          our processes. Together, we can create a healthier future for our
          children and the Earth.
